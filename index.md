This is my home page! My name is Juan Linares and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Computer Science.

<br>
I am a first generation college student. I immigrated from Peru to the United States with my dad and sister when I was only 2 years old. Since I moved to the US at such a young age I consider myself a Californian. For fun I love to play video games, go on hikes and make music. I also LOVE eating different cuisines. Some of my favorites are Indian food, Filipino food, and obviously Peruvian food.

### CPSC 120

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 2 was a favorite because it made me call back to things we learned early in the semester. I was forced to remember that std::string is considered a vector and that the function .at() can throw an exception. I also really like this lab because it was the first time I was able to catch an exception in my own code and deal with a std::out_range_error.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 is another favorite because it was the first program I wrote that I could see would have realworld use. Figuring out where and when I can park within a city is a useful tool and being able to code a program that helps with this made me feel proud. In this program I had to figure out how to carefully use nested if statements.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 also holds a special place in my heart because it was the first time I made a game that was slightly more complex than rock paper scissors or a hilo game. During this lab I learned how Blackjack works and I also learned the importance of how to convert variable types, specifically string to integers. I also felt that this project was challenging and the reward of solving it was a bonus.

## Personal Projects

### Rock Paper Scissors

* This was a personal project that I did on my own time. The purpose of this project was to get more exposure to makefiles. The program is a basic rock paper scissor game that takes command line arguments and determines which player wins. However I also created the makefile that allowed me to compile a header file and two cc files. The link to this repository is [here][def]
