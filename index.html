	<h1>Hello World!</h1>
	    <p>This is my home page! My name is Juan Linares and I am a student at 
		   <a class="txtOrange" href="https://www.fullerton.edu/">
		   Cal State Fullerton</a>
		   and my major is Computer Science.</p>
	<details>
		<summary><b>Get to know more about me!</b></summary>
		<br>
		I am a first gen undergraduate college student. I immigrated from Peru to
		the United States with my dad and sister when I was 2 years old. Since I
		moved to the US at such a young age I consider myself a Californian. 
        For fun I love to play video games, go on hikes and make music. I also LOVE
		eating different cuisines. Some of my favorites are Indian food, Filipino
		food, and obviously Peruvian food. I am currently looking for internships
		that can help me expand my knowledge and experience in Computer Science.
		Thank you for visiting my site.

		<h3>CPSC 120 - Introduction to Programming</h3>
			<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
			<li>Lab 6</li></ul>
				<p>
					Lab 6, part 2 also holds a special place in my heart because it was
					the first time I made a game that was slightly more complex than rock
					paper scissors or a hilo game. During this lab I learned how Blackjack
					works and I also learned the importance of how to convert variable
					types, specifically string to integers. I also felt that this project
					was challenging and the reward of solving it was a bonus.
				</p>
			<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
			<li>Lab 7</li></ul>
				<p>
					Lab 7, part 2 is another favorite because it was the first program I
					wrote that I could see would have real-world use. Figuring out where
					and when I can park within a city is a useful tool and being able to
					code a program that helps with this made me feel proud. In this program
					I had to figure out how to carefully use nested if statements.

	  <h2>Personal Projects</h2>
	    <h3>Rock Paper Scissors</h3>
		  <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		    <li>
			  This was a personal project that I did on my own time. The purpose of
			  this project was to get more exposure to makefiles. The program is a
			  basic rock paper scissor game that takes command line arguments and
			  determines which player wins. However I also created the makefile that
			  allowed me to compile a header file and two cc files. The link to this
			  repository is
